# Insightface-tf

### Intro
- This repositories is a reimplementation of Insightface([github](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface))
- Training code is included, you can use your own data to train models
- We are trying to use new features and Hight Level APIs in TesnsorFlow, such as Keras, Eager Execution, tf.data and so on. The code can even run successful under TF2.0 with a little changes
- The recognition([github-recognition](https://github.com/Fei-Wang/insightface/tree/master/recognition)) with tf-1.14 has been reimplemented and the RetinaFace-tf will be upload soon
